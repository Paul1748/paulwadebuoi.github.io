Emphasis
Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores __work as well__.  
Let's make it *italic now*.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

Blockquote
Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

This is a blockquote. Want to write on a new line with space between?

And nested? No problem at all.

PS. you can style your text as you want. :

Images
The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.
Here is the syntax.

![text if the image fails to load](auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: auto-generated-path-to-file-when-you-upload-image "Hover me"
![error text][logo]
text if the image fails to load

error text
